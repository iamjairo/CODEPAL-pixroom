# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. This project follows semantic versioning once stable releases begin.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Deterministic one-hop unique-key QCV joins across two JSON tool results, with exact local projection and no model-planned retrieval.
- Expanded exact-QCV breadth evidence: 42/42 positive tasks across seven categories and 20/20 adversarial controls refused.

### Safety

- Exact joins fall through on duplicate selector rows, duplicate destination keys, competing datasets, multiple valid join paths, missing rows, oversized projections, or insufficient atomic store capacity. Unsafe JSON integers fall through instead of being rounded.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- GitHub Release-driven publication to the npm registry.
- Receipt-generated README proof graphic, executable documentation checks, and an `llms.txt` project index.
- Independent benchmark reproduction guide and structured replication issue form.
- Source-backed OSS adoption research and a gated public-launch checklist.
- Query-Backed Context Virtualization (QCV) for exact historical JSON, log, and source tool results.
- Deterministic exact current-question prefetch with cache-stable historical manifests across exact selectors.
- Optional bounded Anthropic `pinpoint_query` continuation with aggregate usage accounting.
- Transaction commit hooks for optimizer-owned external state.
- Request-scoped QCV capabilities, entry/byte/request limits, and store health metrics.
- Audit, shadow, optimize, and enforce runtime modes with typed proposal traces.
- CI, security, contribution, issue, and benchmark evidence policies.
- Exact QCV for OpenAI Chat and OpenAI Responses, including streaming requests.
- Server-owned `headroom_retrieve` continuation for Anthropic and OpenAI JSON/SSE clients.
- Fsynced JSONL decision capture and offline `pinpoint replay` evaluation.
- Content-free bounded OTLP/HTTP optimization spans.
- Two external integration examples using only public exports.
- A 36-task exact-QCV breadth suite and isolated three-process latency profile.
- Public CodePal ownership, product relationship, and support metadata.

### Changed

- Renamed the product, CLI, SDK, environment variables, npm package, and repository to Pinpoint.
- The minimum supported Node.js version is now 22.
- Optical model allowlists are now runtime-local, with a reviewed Fable-5-only default.
- Output integrations now receive events in order and are flushed during proxy shutdown.
- Safe exact QCV now defaults on. `PINPOINT_VIRTUAL_CONTEXT=0` or `--no-qcv` disables it.
- Model-driven query fallback is independently gated by `PINPOINT_VIRTUAL_QUERY_FALLBACK=1` or `--virtual-query-fallback`.
- Unchanged routed requests preserve their original wire bytes.
- QCV-only requests smaller than the minimum eligible dataset stream without inspection.

### Safety

- Proxy optimization inspection is capped at 32 MiB by default; oversized requests stream through unchanged.
- Third-party integration analysis now receives a cloned request context so direct proposal-time mutations cannot leak into live requests.
- Provider validation now occurs before QCV storage commits.
- Shadow, rejected, and rolled-back proposals retain no QCV data.
- Mixed tools, failed continuations, invalid responses, and exhausted query rounds replay the original request.
- Model-visible QCV metadata and exact values escape prompt delimiters.
- Body capture is separately gated, stored mode `0600`, and disabled by default.
- Pure internal continuation is required; mixed client/Pinpoint tools replay the original request.
