# Security policy

Pinpoint is maintained by [CodePal](https://codepal.ai).

Pinpoint is an experimental policy gateway for MCP data. It can prevent selected
source and destination values from entering the client-facing MCP transcript, but it
does not remove the need for application security review, network controls, upstream
tool authorization, or compliance assessment.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private **Report a vulnerability** flow in the repository Security tab. Do not open a public issue with exploit details, credentials, private prompts, or raw agent traces. If private reporting is unavailable, email [support@codepal.ai](mailto:support@codepal.ai) to request a private channel and omit technical details from the first message.

Expect an acknowledgement within three business days and an initial severity/scope
assessment within seven calendar days. Critical reports that plausibly expose release
integrity, credentials, or protected MCP values are triaged as soon as practical.
Maintainers will coordinate remediation and disclosure with the reporter, avoid public
details while users remain exposed, and credit reporters who want attribution. Timelines
depend on complexity and downstream coordination; status updates continue until closure.

## Supported versions

Until the first npm publication completes, security fixes target the `main` branch
and signed GitHub release candidates. After publication, fixes target the latest npm
release and `main`. Older prerelease versions may require upgrading.

## Verifying a release

Official release candidates use an annotated SSH-signed `v*` tag verified against the
repository-pinned CodePal signer. The protected release workflow rebuilds one npm
tarball, generates a production CycloneDX SBOM, checksums the tarball, SBOM, and npm
integrity record, and attaches those immutable assets to the GitHub Release. npm
publications from this public repository include provenance.

Compare `dist.integrity` from npm with `PACKAGE_INTEGRITY` from the matching GitHub
Release and verify `SHA512SUMS` before deployment. See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md)
for the complete producer and consumer checks.

## Deployment boundaries

- Pinpoint listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. It is not an authenticated internet-facing gateway. Deploy it on a trusted host or behind your own network isolation and authentication.
- The optional Session Recorder uses a separate `127.0.0.1` server with exact Host/Origin validation, no CORS, authenticated GET-only APIs, and a strict local-only CSP. Its random bearer token is delivered in the URL fragment, removed immediately, and retained in that tab's origin-scoped `sessionStorage` so refresh survives. Closing the tab clears it. Do not bind or reverse-proxy this surface to a network interface.
- Dashboard history is disabled unless a dashboard session is requested. Enabled sessions persist allowlisted metadata under `~/.pinpoint/dashboard` with 30-day/64 MiB bounds. POSIX uses mode-0700 directories and mode-0600 files; Windows inherits the user's profile ACLs and Pinpoint does not install a custom ACL. Processes running as the same OS user may still read those files or process state; loopback and file permissions are not an OS sandbox.
- Dashboard schemas have no fields for prompts, responses, tool arguments/results, headers, credentials, artifact ids/capabilities, fixed policy values, commitments, signatures, or receipt bodies. Bounded tool, model, flow, source, and destination labels plus counts, sizes, timing, outcome, and attribution quality remain observable.
- Opaque-flow policies are plaintext operator files. Do not put credentials or long-lived secrets in `fixedDestinationArguments`; keep authentication in the upstream server's existing credential mechanism.
- Cross-server mode accepts one separate private stdio destination through `--destination-config`. Keep credential values in the environment or workload-identity system, never in the JSON, command arguments, flow policy, opening record, or prompt.
- Destination `envAllowlist` copies only named variables into the destination process. Those names are removed from the source environment unless also explicitly listed in `sharedEnvAllowlist`. Runtime validation requires the shared list to be a subset of the destination list. Treat broad shared lists as a security regression.
- Source and destination processes have independent JSON-RPC request namespaces and tool catalogs. Destination protocol messages, stderr, malformed stdout, server requests, notifications, and result values are not forwarded to the host. The signed receipt binds the configured logical destination-server id.
- Process separation is not a sandbox. Both children run under the same operating-system user unless the operator adds stronger isolation, and may access common files, keychains, network identities, IPC, subprocesses, timing, or kernel resources. Pinpoint does not attest executable/package identity.
- A destination timeout, process loss, malformed result status, or write failure after dispatch produces a signed `destinationSucceeded=false` receipt meaning success was not confirmed when the gateway process survives to flush output. It blocks further private-destination flows and terminates that gateway nonzero. A crash of Pinpoint itself can still omit the receipt. None of these outcomes proves rollback or absence of a side effect. Use destination idempotency keys, reconciliation, or manual review before retrying.
- The operator policy, not the model, defines source and destination tools, operations, fields, filters, argument names, and payload limits. Configured source tools fail closed when exact capture is not possible. Unconfigured result optimization keeps separate fail-open semantics.
- Opaque artifacts and exact tool results remain in bounded process memory until LRU eviction or process exit. The default limits are 256 datasets and 64 MiB. Pinpoint does not persist them to disk.
- The wrapped MCP process is trusted with source and destination values. Pinpoint does not prevent that process from using its own network, filesystem, subprocesses, timing, or other operating-system channels.
- Client-visible receipts conceal values, not metadata. Tool and flow names, field names, operation, item count, byte count, timing, limits, and success status remain observable.
- Duplicate outstanding JSON-RPC request ids are rejected before a second opaque-flow dispatch. Receipt sequence numbers represent serialized terminal emission order, not dispatch-start chronology.
- Receipt signatures prove integrity under a fresh session key pinned during MCP initialization. Optional authority mode binds that session key and an unlinkable commitment to the complete normalized policy to a stable Ed25519 operator key. Verifiers must pin the operator key id out of band; a self-declared key proves no organizational identity.
- Create an authority key with `pinpoint mcp authority init --out <file>`. Pinpoint refuses group/world-readable private-key files and creates keys and opening records with mode `0600` without overwriting existing files. The software key remains online during gateway startup; use your own HSM/external-signing boundary when that assurance is required.
- Policy-opening records are sensitive. They contain a signature rather than plaintext policy values, but anyone holding the record and public policy candidates can test guesses. Retain them only in the audit boundary that already has access to the policy.
- Operator authority does not prove human approval, key-to-organization identity, hardware state, upstream honesty, cross-restart chain continuity, receipt completeness, or absence of selectively discarded sessions. Those require external identity governance, retention, witnesses, or a transparency service.
- Pinpoint returns signed flow receipts through MCP but does not persist them. If durable retention is required, configure the MCP host or an existing collector to store the value-free receipt. `PINPOINT_CAPTURE_BODIES=1` is not a receipt-retention feature and may persist sensitive prompt and tool values.
- Protected source content, result metadata, result extensions, JSON-RPC errors, stderr, and unsolicited upstream messages are suppressed from the client-facing boundary after protected handling begins. Treat this as a defense for the documented protocol path, not a substitute for process isolation.
- Provider credentials remain in the host or wrapped upstream environment. Do not place them in prompts, flow policies, captures, issue reports, or benchmark artifacts.
- Inline reversible originals are independently bounded to 1,000 entries or 64 MiB, expire after 30 minutes, and are cleared at shutdown. A transform rolls back if its own reversible batch cannot fit.
- Managed Headroom children bind to `127.0.0.1`, run stateless with in-memory CCR, and do not inherit provider credential variables. An operator-configured external `PINPOINT_HEADROOM_URL` is a separate trust boundary: selected compression content is sent there and its retention policy applies.
- Exact QCV is enabled only for PAYG Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Chat/Responses traffic. OAuth/subscription traffic passes through. Exact prefetch may be used with streaming responses; model-driven fallback may not.
- Model-driven QCV continuation is experimental and disabled by default. Enable it only after evaluating your own traces.
- Durable capture is disabled by default. Metadata-only capture excludes request bodies. `PINPOINT_CAPTURE_BODIES=1` stores private prompt/tool content in a mode-0600 local file and should be used only on trusted storage.
- OTLP spans contain bounded machine codes and token counters, never request/response bodies or arbitrary integration exception text. Collector headers may contain credentials and must not be logged or committed.
- Audit logs, bug reports, and benchmark fixtures must be sanitized. Treat agent context as potentially secret even when no credential pattern is visible.

## What Pinpoint does not certify

Pinpoint is not a data-loss-prevention suite, identity provider, remote-attestation
service, zero-retention guarantee, or compliance certification. The committed tests
establish exact behavior on synthetic protocol traces and two installed MCP clients.
They do not establish semantic noninterference, production demand, or fitness for a
specific regulatory regime.

Before a production deployment, review the full threat model in
[`planning/value_opaque_mcp_dataflow.md`](./planning/value_opaque_mcp_dataflow.md),
the [bounded formal property map](./planning/opaque_flow_formal_properties.md), run
the protocol and mutation gates against your own sanitized fixture, and obtain
independent security review appropriate to your data and systems.
